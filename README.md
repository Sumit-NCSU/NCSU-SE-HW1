* Steps to Run:
  * Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.ncsu.edu/ssrivas8/HW1`
  * Cd to HW1 directory: `cd HW1`
  * Do `npm install` inside the HW1 folder to install all the dependencies specified in the package.json.
  * To run the scripts type: `node <scriptname>.js` , where `scriptname` is the name of the script to be run.

**Note: For the scripts, you need to enter your github token, your github username (from public GitHub) and your reponame in the `token`, `owner` and `reponame` variables inside all the scripts. For my testing, I have used the following repo on my public GitHub: [se_hw1_sample](https://github.com/srivassumit/se_hw1_sample)

* Code:
  * [List Branches](listbranches.js)
  * [Create a new Repo](createrepo.js)
  * [Create an Issue](createissue.js)
  * [Editing a Repo](editrepo.js)
  * [Listing Reactions](listreactions.js)

* Concepts:
  1. Additional concerns related to REST APIs.

  2. Benefits and disadvantages of using a RESTful architecture vs. a graph query language.
